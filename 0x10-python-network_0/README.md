Project Overview
This project is part of the SE Foundations curriculum, focusing on Python and Networking. It aims to deepen understanding of HTTP, cURL, and Bash scripting, with a particular emphasis on making HTTP requests and handling responses. The project includes a variety of tasks that require the use of cURL for HTTP requests and Bash scripting for automating these requests.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand and explain the concepts of URLs, HTTP, domain names, sub-domains, port numbers, query strings, HTTP requests, HTTP responses, HTTP headers, HTTP message bodies, HTTP request methods, HTTP response status codes, and HTTP Cookies.
Make HTTP requests using cURL.
Write Bash scripts for automating HTTP requests and handling responses.
Understand the structure and components of a URL.
Explain the process of making a request when typing a URL into a browser.
Requirements
All scripts must be written in Bash or Python, as specified by the task.
Bash scripts must be exactly 3 lines long.
Python files must adhere to pycodestyle version 2.8.*.
All files must be executable and end with a new line.
The first line of all Bash files should be #!/bin/bash, and the first line of all Python files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
All curl commands must use the -s option for silent mode.
Documentation is required for all modules, classes, and functions.
Tasks
Bash Scripts
cURL body size: Write a script to display the size of the body of a response in bytes.
cURL to the end: Write a script to display the body of a 200 status code response.
cURL Method: Write a script to send a DELETE request and display the response body.
cURL only methods: Write a script to display all HTTP methods the server will accept.
cURL headers: Write a script to send a GET request with a custom header and display the response body.
cURL POST parameters: Write a script to send a POST request with parameters and display the response body.
Only status code: Write a script to display only the status code of the response.
cURL a JSON file: Write a script to send a JSON POST request with the contents of a file and display the response body.
Catch me if you can!: Write a script that makes a specific request to receive a specific response.
Python Function
Find a peak: Write a function to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers without using any modules.
Getting Started
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd 0x10-python-network_0
Make sure all scripts are executable: chmod +x *.sh
Run the Bash scripts as per the instructions provided in the tasks.
For the Python function, run the test script: ./6-main.py
